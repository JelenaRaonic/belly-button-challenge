# belly-button-challenge

The goal of this challenge is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This is a result of the Dashboard that I got.

In this challenge I used Plotly and D3 libraries, and the languages used are HTML and JavaScript.

It was interesting challenge to work on, and I appreciate help from tutoring service.
